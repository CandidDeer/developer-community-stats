# Hi, I'm Moises!

## Web developer and permanent learner

Hi! I'm a developer from Brazil. I'm new to the open source community and decided to focus my efforts on learning more.
I've studied development through the Harvard's CS50 program and worked on some projects. I'm using **Django** to make my websites, and started to learn Front-end frameworks such as **React** and **Angular**, and some **PHP** as it still is one of the most required languages on market.

-   Currently learning PHP and improving skills with Python and Javascript
-   Looking foward to contribute to the open-source community
